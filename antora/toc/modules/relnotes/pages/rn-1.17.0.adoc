This two main features in this release are the ability for dialog actions to be use a sidebar rather than a modal dialog (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1997[ISIS-1997]), and the ability to export the metamodel as XML (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-2003[ISIS-2003]).

With respect to general improvements, for the end-user they hopefully will notice that tabbing behaviour around the UI is much improved (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-2053[ISIS-2053]), while internally the way in which the metamodel is built up has been revamped so that this is now done in parallel (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1974[ISIS-1974]).
It's also possible to more fully customise the footer (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-2009[ISIS-2009], link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-2022[ISIS-2022]), and new configuration properties mean that in many cases there should no longer be any need to subclass `IsisWicketApplication` (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-2023[ISIS-2023]).

In terms of notable bugs, there have been several fixes for the Restful Objects viewer (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-2046[ISIS-2046], link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-2045[ISIS-2045]).
