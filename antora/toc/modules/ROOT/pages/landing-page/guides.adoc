This page lists the user and reference guides available for developers to create applications with the framework.

== Core

The core guides describe how to write domain applications:

* *xref:userguide:ROOT:about.adoc[User Guide]*
+
Consists of two sections: fundamentals, and "beyond the basics".

* *xref:refguide:ROOT:about.adoc[Reference Guide]*
+
Reference for the annotations, domain services and naming conventions.

* *xref:testing:ROOT:about.adoc[Testing]*
+
How to write unit tests, integration tests and BDD (Cucumber) tests, and how to use fixtures within integration tests and for rapid prototyping.


== Libraries

There are three sets of libraries:

*  xref:subdomains:ROOT:about.adoc[Subdomains]
+
Contains libraries to be called from the domain application itself, to integrate with various subdomains.
+
These subdomains are usually technical in nature, for example to perform a mail merge in MS Word, or to zip up files.

*  xref:valuetypes:ROOT:about.adoc[Value Types]
+
Support for additional value types, for example an Markdown.

*  xref:mappings:ROOT:about.adoc[Bounded Context Mappings]
+
Provides libraries for integrating (or mapping) between the Apache Isis application and other bounded contexts.
+
Some/many of these libraries are for code hosted outside of the Apache Isis application, ie which call into it.
Others are SPIs that are called by the framework implicitly rather than by your domain logic directly.


As well as the current libraries, the xref:incubator:ROOT:about.adoc[Incubator] may have additional libraries that may end up graduating to the extensions catalog, while the xref:legacy:ROOT:about.adoc[Legacy Catalog] may contain libraries that have been deprecated and are on the way out.
