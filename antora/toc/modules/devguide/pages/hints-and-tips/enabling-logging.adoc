Sometimes you just need to see what is going on.
There are various ways in which logging can be enabled, here are the ones we tend to use.

* In Apache Isis +
+
Modify `WEB-INF/logging.properties` (a log4j config file)

* In DataNucleus +
+
As per the http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/logging.html[DN logging page]

* In the JDBC Driver +
+
Configure `log4jdbc` JDBC rather than the vanilla driver (see `WEB-INF/persistor_datanucleus.properties`) and configure log4j logging (see `WEB-INF/logging.properties`).
There are examples of both in the link:https://github.com/apache/isis-app-simpleapp[SimpleApp archetype].

* In the database +
+
Details below.


Database logging can be configured:

* for HSQLDB +
+
by adding`;sqllog=3` to the end of the JDBC URL.

* for PostgreSQL: +
+
Can change `postgresql\9.2\data\postgresql.conf`; see link:http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/runtime-config-logging.html[this article] for details.

* for MS SQL Server Logging: +
+
We like to use the excellent SQL Profiler tool.
