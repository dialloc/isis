From the Apache Isis mailing list is:

* _Is there a simple way to make a run configuration in IntelliJ for running the datanucleus enhancer before running integration test?_

Yes, you can; here's one way:

* Duplicate your run configuration for running the webapp
** the one where the main class is `org.apache.isis.WebServer`
** there's a button for this on the run configurations dialog.
* then, on your copy change the main class to `org.apache.isis.Dummy`

Or, you could just write a small shell script and run from the command line:

[source,bash]
.enhance.sh
----
mvn -pl dom datanucleus:enhance -o
