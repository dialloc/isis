The easiest way to consume the framework is to use one of the xref:starters:ROOT:about.adoc[starter apps].
Then, just update the `<version>` of the parent starter:

[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-app-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>                            <!--1-->
</parent>
----
<1> update as required.

If you want though you can also xref:toc:ROOT:downloads/how-to.adoc[download] the source code and build it directly.

For each release, consult:

* xref:toc:relnotes:about.adoc[Release Notes]
+
to learn about new features, improvements and bug fixes

* xref:toc:mignotes:about.adoc[Migration Notes]
+
to learn how to migrate to new features / away from deprecated or removed features.

If you like to live on the bleeding edge, there are also nightly builds of the framework.

* link:https://github.com/apache-isis-committers/isis-nightly[CI]
* link:https://repo.incode.cloud/[Maven Repo]
* link:https://apache-isis-committers.github.io/isis-nightly/toc/about.html[Website preview]

Although these are maintained and used by the framework's committers, do be aware that *these are _not_ official ASF releases*; they are provided as a convenience only.
