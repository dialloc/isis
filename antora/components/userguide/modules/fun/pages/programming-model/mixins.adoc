A xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#mixins[mixin] acts like a trait or extension method, allowing one module to contribute behaviour or derived state to another object.

Syntactically, a mixin is defined using either the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Mixin.adoc[`@Mixin`] annotation or using xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#nature[`@DomainObject#nature()`] attribute (specifying a nature of `Nature.MIXIN`).

WARNING: TODO: v2: perhaps we should get rid of @DomainObject#nature=MIXIN ?

@Mixin(method="coll")                                       // <1>
public class Customer_orders {                              // <2>

    private final Customer customer;
    public Customer_orders(final Customer customer) {       // <3>
        this.customer = customer;
    }

    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)                     // <4>
    @ActionLayout(contributed=Contributed.AS_ASSOCIATION)   // <4>
    @CollectionLayout(defaultView="table")
    public List<Order> coll() {                             // <1>
        return repositoryService.findOrdersFor(customer);
    }

    @Inject
    RepositoryService repositoryService;
}
----
<1> indicates that this is a mixin, with "coll" as the name of the main method
<2> The contributed member is inferred from the name, after the "_"; in other words "orders"
<3> The mixee is `Customer`.
This could also be an interface.
<4> Indicates that the action should be interpreted as a collection.
This requires that the action has safe semantics, ie does not alter state/no side-effects.
