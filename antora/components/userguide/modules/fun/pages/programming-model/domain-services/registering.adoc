WARNING: TODO: v2: this is out of date, need to xref Spring Boot mechanism instead.


The easiest way to register domain services with the framework is to use an xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/AppManifest-bootstrapping.adoc[`AppManifest`].
This specifies the modules which contain xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainService.adoc[`@DomainService`]-annotated classes.

For example:

[source,ini]
----
public class MyAppManifest implements AppManifest {
    public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
        return Arrays.asList(
                ToDoAppDomainModule.class,
                ToDoAppFixtureModule.class,
                ToDoAppAppModule.class,
                org.isisaddons.module.audit.AuditModule.class);
    }
    ...
}
----

will load all services in the packages underneath the four modules listed.


Examples of framework-provided services (as defined in the applib) include clock, auditing, publishing, exception handling, view model support, snapshots/mementos, and user/application settings management; see the xref:refguide:applib-svc:about.adoc[domain services] reference guide for further details.
