WARNING: TODO: v2: support for init with a Map is no longer supported, I suspect...?  Instead, can x-ref Spring's strongly typed configuration beans

Services can optionally declare lifecycle callbacks to initialize them (when the app is deployed) and to shut them down (when the app is undeployed).

An Apache Isis session _is_ available when initialization occurs (so services can interact with the object store, for example).

The framework will call any `public` method annotated with xref:refguide:applib-ant:PostConstruct.adoc[`@PostConstruct`] with either no arguments of an argument of type `Map<String,String>`.
In the latter case, the framework passes in the configuration.

Shutdown is similar; the framework will call any method annotated with xref:refguide:applib-ant:PreDestroy.adoc[`@PreDestroy`].
