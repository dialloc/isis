WARNING: TODO: v2: update for Spring events rather than axon/guava

Domain services acting as event subscribers can subscribe to xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#lifecycle-events[lifecycle] events, influencing the rendering and behaviour of other objects.

All subscribers must subscribe to the xref:refguide:applib-svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`]; as this amounts to a few lines of boilerplate it's easiest to inherit from the convenience `AbstractSubscriber` class.

We suggest naming such classes `XxxSubscriptions`, for example:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

@DomainService( nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN )         // <1>
public class CustomerOrderSubscriptions
                    extends AbstractSubscriber {        // <2>

    @EventListener(Customer.DeletedEvent.class)         // <3>
    public void on(final Customer.DeletedEvent ev) {    // <4>
        Customer customer = ev.getSource();
        orderRepository.delete(customer);
    }

    @Inject
    OrderRepository orderRepository;
}
----
<1> subscriptions do not appear in the UI at all
<2> subclass from the `AbstractSubscriber` convenience superclass
<3> use Spring Frameworkr's `@EventListener`
<4> the parameter type of the method corresponds to the event emitted on the event bus.
The actual method name does not matter (though it must have `public` visibility).
