One use case that Apache Isis supports is that of a domain object with a lifecycle whereby at some stage it should become immutable: all its properties/collections should be disabled, and/or its actions become not invokable.

It would be painful to have to write a separate xref:refguide:applib-cm:methods.adoc#reserved-disable[`disable...()`] method for each and every member, so instead Isis allows a single `disable...(...)` method to be implemented that is applied to all members.

The signature of the method is:

[source,java]
----
public String disabled(Identifier.Type identifierType) { /* ... */ }
----

where `Identifier.Type` is part of the Isis applib (nested static class of `o.a.i.applib.Identifier`) to distinguish between an interaction with an action, a property or an action.

Note that Apache Isis' xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[i18n support] extends this so that the returned reason can also be internationalized.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public String disabled(Identifier.Type identifierType) {
    return !calendarService.isOfficeHours(clock.today()
            ? "Cannot modify objects outside of office hours"
            : null;
}
----

See also the similar methods to xref:refguide:applib-cm:methods.adoc#hide[`hide()`] object members en-masse.


== Alternatives

An alternative design -- and one that could be easily argued is actually more flexible -- is to leverage domain events with vetoing subscribers.

With this approach we define, for a given domain class, a base `PropertyDomainEvent`, `CollectionDomainEvent` and `ActionDomainEvent`.
A good pattern is to make these nested static classes.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    public static abstract class PropertyDomainEvent<T>
            extends ToDoAppDomainModule.PropertyDomainEvent<ToDoItem, T> {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
----

where in turn:

[source,java]
----
public final class ToDoAppDomainModule {
    private ToDoAppDomainModule(){}
    public abstract static class PropertyDomainEvent<S,T>
            extends org.apache.isis.applib.events.domain.PropertyDomainEvent<S,T> { }
    ...
}
----

Then, each property/collection/action emits either these base domain events or their own subclass:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem  {
    public static class DescriptionDomainEvent extends PropertyDomainEvent<String> { }
    @Property( domainEvent = DescriptionDomainEvent.class )
    public String getDescription() {
        ...
     }

    ...
}
----

A vetoing subscriber can then subscribe to the domain events and veto access, eg:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class VetoOutOfOfficeHours {
    @EventListener(ToDoItem.PropertyDomainEvent.class)
    public void on(ToDoItem.PropertyDomainEvent ev) {
        if(!calendarService.isOfficeHours(clock.today())) {
            ev.veto("Cannot modify objects outside of office hours");
        }
    }
}
----

Obviously there's an awful lot more boilerplate here, but there's also a lot more flexibility.
