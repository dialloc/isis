The `disable...()` supporting method is called for properties, actions and action parameters.
It allows the modification of the property to be vetoed (ie made read-only) and to prevent the invocation of the action ("grey it out").
For parameters, it disables the entry into the parameter; this is for actions with dependencies between the parameters.

Typically modification/invocation is vetoed based on the state of the domain object being interacted with, though it could be any reason at all (eg the current date/time of the interaction, or the state of some other related data such as stock levels, or the identity of the calling user).


The reason for vetoing a modification/invocation is normally returned as a string.
However, Apache Isis' xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[i18n support] extends this so that reasons can be internationalized.



The signature of the supporting method is generally:

[source,java]
----
public String disableXxx() { /* ... */ }
----

where the returned string is the reason the property cannot be edited, or the action invoked.


For i18n, the supporting method returns a `TranslatableString`:

[source,java]
----
public TranslatableString disableXxx() { /* ... */ }
----

The returned string is then automatically translated to the locale of the current user.


To disable a property:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { /* ... */ }

    public BigDecimal getCreditLimit() { /* ... */ }
    public void setCreditLimit(BigDecimal creditLimit) { /* ... */ }
    public String disableCreditLimit() {
        return isBlacklisted()
                    ? "Cannot change credit limit for blacklisted customers"
                    : null;
    }
    ...
}
----


Or, to disable an action:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { /* ... */ }

    public Order placeOrder(
            final Product product,
            @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
            final int quantity) {
        ...
    }
    public String disablePlaceOrder() {
        return isBlacklisted()
                    ? "Blacklisted customers cannot place orders"
                    : null;
    }
    ...
}
----


[NOTE]
====
// TODO: v2: remove this feature, instead should fail-fast if there's a disableXxx() method with parameters.
//  Ditto for hideXxx().

In the case of actions, the framework will also search for supporting method that has the exact same parameter types as the action itself.
Enabling `isis.reflector.validator.noParamsOnly` configuration property switches this off, so that the framework will only search for supporting method with no parameters.

Note that enabling this configuration property in effect means that xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#mixins[mixins] must be used instead of xref:userguide:fun:programming-model.adoc#contributions[contributed services] (because contributed actions are the one case where the value of a parameter to a supporting method may be non-null).
====


It is also possible to disable an action parameter, so that it is disabled (greyed out) based on the value of earlier parameters.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public Product categorize(Category category, Subcategory subcategory) { /* ... */}
public String disable1Categorize(Category category) {
    return category == null category.hasSubcategories() ? null : "The selected category has no subcategories"
}
----
