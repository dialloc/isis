== Property or Collection

To hide a property or collection:

[source,java]
----
public String getStatus() { /* ... */ }
public void setStatus(String status) { /* ... */ }

public boolean hideStatus() { /* ... */ }
----

== Object Action

An object action can be hidden similarly:

[source,java]
----
public Customer placeOrder(Product p, int quantity) { /* ... */ }
public boolean hidePlaceOrder() { /* ... */ }
----

If the `hideXxx` method returns `true` then the action is hidden.
Note that the supporting method takes no parameters.


== Action Parameter

It is also possible to hide an action parameter, based on the value of some other earlier parameter:
Each `hideNXxx()` method can declare parameters for the previous N-1 parameters, though it need not declare them all.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    public Order shipTo(
            boolean sameAsBillingAddress,
            String addressLine1,
            String addressLine2,
            String addressCity,
            String addressPostalCode,
            String addressCountry
    ) { /* ... */ }
    public boolean hide1ShipTo(boolean sameAsBillingAddress) { return sameAsBillingAddress; }
    public boolean hide2ShipTo(boolean sameAsBillingAddress) { return sameAsBillingAddress; }
    public boolean hide3ShipTo(boolean sameAsBillingAddress) { return sameAsBillingAddress; }
    public boolean hide4ShipTo(boolean sameAsBillingAddress) { return sameAsBillingAddress; }
    public boolean hide5ShipTo(boolean sameAsBillingAddress) { return sameAsBillingAddress; }
}
----

In this case, the user can use the `shipTo(...)` action to specify where to ship the `Order` to.
However, if they check the first boolean parameter (ie, to ship the `Order` to the billing address already held on file), then the remaining parameters will all be hidden.
