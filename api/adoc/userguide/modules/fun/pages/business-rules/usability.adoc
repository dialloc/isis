== Property

To disable a property (so that it cannot be edited):

[source,java]
----
@Getter @Setter
private String notes;

public String disableNotes() {
    return isArchived() ? "The notes of archived objects cannot be modified" : null;
}
----

To make _all_ of the properties of a domain object unmodifiable, use:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    editing=Editing.DISABLED
)
public class Customer { /* ... */ }
----

This can be made a global policy using a xref:refguide:config:configuring-core.adoc#isis-objects-editing[configuration setting]:

.isis.properties
[source,ini]
----
isis.objects.editing=false
----


== Collections

Collections are always read-only; there is no notion of adding or removing from a collection implicitly.
To add to or remove from a collection, an action should be defined.



== Actions

To disable an object action:

[source,java]
----
public Customer placeOrder(Product p, int quantity) { /* ... */ }
public String disablePlaceOrder() { /* ... */ }
----

Here a non-`null` value is used as the reason why the action is disabled.
A localized string can be returned using `TranslatableString`.


== Action Parameters

It is also possible to disable an action parameter, so that it is disabled (greyed out) based on the value of earlier parameters.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public Product categorize(Category category, Subcategory subcategory) { /* ... */}
public String disable1Categorize(Category category) {
    return category == null category.hasSubcategories() ? null : "The selected category has no subcategories"
}
----


== For more information

For more information, see  xref:refguide:applib-cm:methods.adoc#disable[`disable...()`] section in the appropriate reference guide.


It is also possible to hide an action parameter, based on the value of some other earlier parameter:
Each `hideNXxx()` method can declare parameters for the previous N-1 parameters, though it need not declare them all.
