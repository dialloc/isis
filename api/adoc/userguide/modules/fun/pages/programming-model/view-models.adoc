As described in the xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#view-models[introduction], view models are domain objects like domain entities, with behaviour and state.
However, unlike domain entities, their state is _not_ persisted to a database but is instead serialized into its identifier (in effect, its URL).

The framework provides two main ways to implement a view model:

* The more powerful/flexible approach is to use JAXB annotations; this allows the state of the object's properties and also its collections.
+
The serialized form of these view models is therefore XML, which also enables these view models to act as DTO (useful for various integration scenarios).

* The other approach is to use Apache Isis specific annotations.
+
While (arguably) these explain the intent of the view model better, they are more restrictive: only the state of the object's properties is serialized -- collections are ignored -- and not every datatype is recognized.
+
On the other hand, they are more likely to perform better.
This could be a factor for example in a dashboard/home page that references many view model instances.

In the sections below we consider JAXB view models both as "regular" view models, and also when using them to act as DTOs.
