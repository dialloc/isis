Where the mixin follows the naming convention `SomeType_mixinName` then the method name can be abbreviated, and the name of the member being contributed is inferred from the name of the class itself, being everything after the last '_'.


For example:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin(method="act")
public class DocumentHolder_documents {

    private final DocumentHolder holder;
    public DocumentHolder_documents(DocumentHolder holder) { this.holder = holder; }

    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    @ActionLayout(contributed = Contributed.AS_ASSOCIATION)
    @CollectionLayout(defaultView="table")
    public List<Document> act() {
        ...
    }
    public boolean hideAct() { /* ... */ }
}
----


The examples above (for xref:userguide:fun:programming-model.adoc#contributed-action[action]) demonstrate this.


The character "$" is also recognized as a separator between the mixin type and mixin name.
This is useful for mixins implemented as nested static types, discussed xref:userguide:fun:programming-model.adoc#nested-static-classes[below].
