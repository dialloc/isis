The example below shows how to contribute a collection:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin(method="coll")                                           // <1>
public class DocumentHolder_documents {

    private final DocumentHolder holder;
    public DocumentHolderDocuments(DocumentHolder holder) { this.holder = holder; }

    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)                         // <2>
    @ActionLayout(contributed = Contributed.AS_ASSOCIATION)     // <3>
    @CollectionLayout(defaultView="table")
    public List<Document> coll() {                              // <4>
        ...
    }
    public boolean hideColl() { /* ... */ }                           // <5>
}
----
<1> indicates this is a mixin, and in this case nominates the method name.
The recommended name for collections is "coll" (if none is specified the default name is "$$").
<2> required; actions that have side-effects cannot be contributed as collections
<3> required; otherwise the mixin will default to being rendered as an action
<4> method (which must match `@Mixin#method` above), must accept no arguments.
The mixin is a collection rather than a property because the return type is a collection, not a scalar.
<5> supporting methods follow the usual naming conventions.
(That said, in the case of collections, because the collection is derived/read-only, the only supporting method that is relevant is `hideColl()`).

The above will result in a contributed collection "documents" for all types that implement/extend from `DocumentHolder`.
