As noted in the introduction, while mixins were originally introduced as a means of allowing contributions from one module to the types of another module, they are also a convenient mechanism for grouping functionality/behaviour against a concrete type.
All the methods and supporting methods end up in a single construct, and the dependency between that functionality and the rest of the object is made more explicit.

When using mixins in this fashion, it is idiomatic to write the mixin as a nested static class, using the naming convention described above to reduce duplication.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @Mixin(method="act")
    public static class placeOrder {                                            // <1>

        private final Customer customer;
        public placeOrder(Customer customer) { this.customer = customer; }      // <2>

        @Action
        @ActionLayout(contributed = Contributed.AS_ACTION)
        public List<Order> act(Product p, int quantity) {                        // <3>
            ...
        }
        public boolean hideAct() { /* ... */ }                                         // <4>
        public String validate0Act(Product p) { ...  }
    }
}
----
<1> By convention, start with a lower case, though will also work fine if capitalized.
<2> typically contributed to concrete class, ie the outer class
<3> implementation as usual
<4> supporting methods as usual
