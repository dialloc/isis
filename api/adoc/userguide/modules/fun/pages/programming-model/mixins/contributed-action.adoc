Contributed actions are defined similarly, for example:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin(method="act")                                            // <1>
public class DocumentHolder_addDocument {

    private final DocumentHolder holder;
    public DocumentHolderDocuments(DocumentHolder holder) { this.holder = holder; }

    @Action()
    @ActionLayout(contributed = Contributed.AS_ACTION)          // <2>
    public Document> act(Document doc) {                        // <3>
        ...
    }
    public boolean hideAct() { /* ... */ }                            // <4>
}
----
<1> indicates this is a mixin, and in this case nominates the method name.
The recommended name for properties is "prop" (if none is specified the default name is "$$").
<2> recommended
<3> method must match `@Mixin#method` above.
Unlike contributed properties and collections, contributed actions can accept parameters.
<4> supporting methods follow the usual naming conventions.
