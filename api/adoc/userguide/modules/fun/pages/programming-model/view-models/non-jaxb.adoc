Instead of using JAXB to specify a view model, it is also possible to use Apache Isis-specific annotations.

As was explained xref:userguide:fun:programming-model.adoc#view-models[earlier], the approach is described here is neither as flexible nor as powerful as using the JAXB-style of view models.
It is however likely to be faster.

WARNING: TODO: v2: I think we should only support programmatic API (ViewModel), and JAXB.
//  So let's get rid of all these other natures that, under the covers, are all our original poor-man's JAXB (ie, EXTERNAL_ENTITY, INMEMORY_ENTITY, VIEW_MODEL, and @ViewModel itself).


While the underlying technique is the same irrespective of use case, the programming model provides various ways of defining a view model so that the original intent is not lost.
They are:

| Use case
| Code
| Description


| External entity
|[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature=Nature.EXTERNAL_ENTITY)
public class CustomerRecordOnSAP { /* ... */ }
----
|Annotated with xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#nature[`@DomainObject#nature()`] and a nature of `EXTERNAL_ENTITY`, with memento derived automatically from the properties of the domain object.  Collections are ignored, as are any properties annotated as xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#notPersisted[not persisted].

| In-memory entity
|[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature=Nature.INMEMORY_ENTITY)
public class Log4JAppender { /* ... */ }
----
|As preceding, but using a nature of `INMEMORY_ENTITY`.

|Application view model
|[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature=Nature.VIEW_MODEL)
public class Dashboard { /* ... */ }
----
|As preceding, but using a nature of `VIEW_MODEL`.

|Application view model
|
[source,java]
----
@ViewModel
public class Dashboard { /* ... */ }
----

|Annotated with xref:refguide:applib-ant:ViewModel.adoc[`@ViewModel`] annotation (effectively just an alias)' memento is as preceding: from "persisted" properties, collections ignored

|Application view model
|
[source,java]
----
public class ExcelUploadManager implements ViewModel {
  public String viewModelMemento() { /* ... */ }
  public void viewModelInit(String memento) { /* ... */ }
}
----
|Implement xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/super.adoc#ViewModel[`ViewModel`] interface.  The memento is as defined by the
interface's methods: the programmer has full control (but also full responsibility) for the string memento.
