This chapter shows the idioms for creating, reading, updating and deleting xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#domain-entities[domain entities].
The main domain services used for this are xref:refguide:applib-svc:persistence-layer-api/RepositoryService.adoc[`RepositoryService`] and xref:refguide:applib-svc:core-domain-api/FactoryService.adoc[`FactoryService`].

It also shows how to instantiate xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#view-models[view models] and how to programmatically instantiate xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#mixins[mixins] (useful primarily for xref:testing:integtestsupport:about.adoc[integration testing]).
