The final type of domain object is the *mixin*.
These are similar to traits or extension methods in other programming languages, in that they contribute (or rather, mixin) both behaviour or (derived) state to entities/view models.

A mixin object allows one class to contribute behaviour - actions, (derived) properties and (derived) collections - to another domain object, either a domain entity or view model.

This allows the app to stay decoupled, so that it doesn't degrade into the proverbial link:http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud["big ball of mud"].
Mixins allow dependencies to be inverted, so that the dependencies between modules can be kept acyclic and under control.

For example, the contributee (eg `Customer`, being mixed into) is in one module, while the contributor mixin (`DocumentHolder_documents`) is in some other module.
The `customer` module knows about the `document` module, but not vice versa.

Mixins are also a convenient mechanism for grouping functionality even for a concrete type, helping to rationalize about the dependency between the data and the behaviour.
Each mixin is in effect a single behavioural "responsibility" of the domain object.

In fact, we find mixins nicely balance inside-out vs outside-in ways of thinking about a system:

* inside-out tends to focus on the structure, the nouns that make up the domain.

* outside-in tends to focus on the behaviour, that is the functionality that the system provides to automate the business processes; the verbs, in other words.

So, while Apache Isis allows you to put behaviour onto the underlying domain entities, it can often be better to treat the domain entities as immutable.
Instead, use mixins to implement behaviour.
When using agile development methodology, it's common for a user story to correspond to a new mixin.

There are also practical reasons for moving behaviour out of entities even within the same module, because structuring your application this way helps support hot-reloading of Java classes (so that you can modify and recompile your application without having to restart it).
This can provide substantial productivity gains.

The Hotspot JVM has limited support for hot reloading; generally you can change method implementations but you cannot introduce new methods.
However, the link:https://dcevm.github.io/[DCEVM] open source project will patch the JVM to support much more complete hot reloading support.
There are also, of course, commercial products such as JRebel.

.DCI Architecture
****
Mixins are an implementation of the link:http://www.artima.com/articles/dci_vision.html[DCI architecture] architecture, as formulated and described by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Reenskaug[Trygve Reenskaug] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Coplien[Jim Coplien].
Reenskaug was the inventor of the MVC pattern (and also the external examiner for Richard Pawson's link:../../../../../ug/fun/_attachments/core-concepts/Pawson-Naked-Objects-thesis.pdf[PhD thesis]), while Coplien has a long history in object-orientation, C++ and patterns.

DCI stands for Data-Context-Interaction and is presented as an evolution of object-oriented programming, but one where behaviour is bound to objects dynamically rather than statically in some context or other.
The mixin pattern is Apache Isis' straightforward take on the same basic concept.
