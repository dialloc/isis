The framework provides default implementations for many of the xref:refguide:applib-svc:about.adoc[domain services].
This is convenient, but sometimes you will want to replace the default implementation with your own service implementation.

For example, suppose you wanted to provide your own implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:presentation-layer-spi/LocaleProvider.adoc[`LocaleProvider`].
The trick is to use the Spring link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html[`@Order`] annotation or equivalent mechanism.

Here's how:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@Order(OrderPrecedence.HIGH)                                // <1>
public class MyLocaleProvider implements LocaleProvider {
    @Override
    public Locale getLocale() { /* ... */ }
}
----
<1> `OrderPrecedence` (in the Apache Isis applib) provides some standard values.

If multiple instances are injected, eg:

[source,java]
----
@javax.inject.Inject
private List<LocalProvider> localeProviders;
----

then all implementations will be present in the list, ordered by priority.








== Decorating existing implementations

It's also quite common to want to decorate the existing implementation (ie have your own implementation delegate to the default); this is also possible and quite easy:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(
        nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN
)
@DomainServiceLayout(
        menuOrder = "1"                                                                             // <1>
)
public class MyLocaleProvider implements LocaleProvider {
    @Override
    public Locale getLocale() {
        return getDelegateLocaleProvider().getLocale();                                             // <2>
    }
    Optional<LocaleProvider> delegateLocaleProvider;                                                // <3>
    private LocaleProvider getDelegateLocaleProvider() {
        if(delegateLocaleProvider == null) {
            delegateLocaleProvider = Iterables.tryFind(localeProviders, input -> input != this);    // <4>
        }
        return delegateLocaleProvider.orNull();
    }
    @Inject
    List<LocaleProvider> localeProviders;                                                           // <5>
}
----
<1> takes precedence over the default implementation when injected elsewhere.
<2> this implementation merely delegates to the default implementation
<3> lazily populated
<4> delegate to the first implementation that isn't _this_ implementation (else infinite loop!)
<5> Injects all implementations, including this implemenation
