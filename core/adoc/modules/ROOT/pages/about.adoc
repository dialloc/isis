:page-partial:

This guide documents the design and implementation of the core framework.

There is documentation for most, though not all, of the core framework.
The ones that are missing - for example the `core/applib` module - instead contribute to the end-user documentation set.
They will therefore be found in either the xref:userguide:ROOT:about.adoc[user guide], xref:refguide:ROOT:about.adoc[reference guide], xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[security guide] or xref:testing:ROOT:about.adoc[testing guide].
