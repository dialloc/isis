The starter app parent POM is provided as a convenience to act as the `<parent>` for Apache Isis applications.
It builds upon a similar POM provided by the Spring Boot framework, which ensures a consistent set of dependencies, as well as configuring various build plugins.

To use it, just add:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-app-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>                            <!--1-->
</parent>
----
<1> update as required for new versions of the framework.

You'll see that it is used by both the xref:starters:helloworld:about.adoc[HelloWorld] and xref:starters:simpleapp:about.adoc[SimpleApp] starter apps.

The link:{attachmentsdir}/parent-pom.pptx[diagram] below shows how the parent POM relates to other POMs:

image::parent-pom.png[width="600px",link="{imagesdir}/parent-pom.png"]

In more detail, the parent POM:

* inherits from `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-parent`
+
which configures various `<build>/<plugins>` and `<resources`>

* transitively inherits from `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies`
+
which defines numerous `xxx.version` properties for various third party applications, and sets up corresponding `<dependencyManagement>/<dependencies>`.
These have been validated as being compatible with each other by the Spring Boot team.

* imports `org.apache.isis.core:isis` (using scope=import, type=pom)
+
\... setting up `<dependencyManagement>/<dependencies>` entries for all of the core modules.
+
TIP: The two core modules most commonly referenced in domain applications are `o.a.i.core:isis-applib` and `o.a.i.core:isis-schema`.

* similarly imports `o.a.i.testing:isis-testing`, for the `isis-testing-xxx` modules

* imports `o.a.i.extensions:isis-extensions`, for `isis-extension-xxx` modules

* imports `o.a.i.subdomains:isis-subdomains`, for `isis-subdomain-xxx` modules

* imports `o.a.i.mappings:isis-mappings`, for `isis-mappings-xxx` modules

* imports `o.a.i.valuetypes:isis-valuetypes`, for `isis-valuetypes-xxx` modules

* imports `o.a.i.incubator:isis-incubator`, for `isis-incubator-xxx` modules

* imports `o.a.i.legacy:isis-legacy`, for `isis-legacy-xxx` modules
