[CAUTION]
====
The xref:starters:parent-pom:about.adoc[Parent POM] configures the Maven surefire plugin in three separate executions for unit test, integ test and BDD specs.
This relies on a naming convention:

* unit tests, which must have a suffix `Test`, but excluding ...
* integ tests, which must have the suffix `IntegTest`
* BDD specs, which must have suffix `IntegBddSpecs`

Not following this convention is likely to cause integ tests/specs to fail.
